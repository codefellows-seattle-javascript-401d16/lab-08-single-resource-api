## Lab-Steve Lab-08 Documentation
  * index.js imports lib/server.js and starts the server on port 3000.
  * lib/server.js defines all routes and leverages lib/router.js to handle request methods, which uses lib/request-parse.js to parse the data sent in POST as JSON.
  PARTIAL COMPLETE THIS!!!!
    * Any method called against localhost:3000 returns a status code of 200 and text, 'Hello World!'.
    * Any method called against localhost:3000/<something that doesn't exist> returns a status code of 404.
    * GET called against localhost:3000/cowsay returns a status code of 400 and a custom cowsay message.
    * POST called against localhost:3000/cowsay without any data returns a status code of 400 and a different custom cowsay message and PUT requests
    * POST called against localhost:3000/cowsay with data formated as <text=something> returns a cowsay message including <something> along with a status code of 200.
  * Tests - Mocha spins up the server before all tests and spins it down afterwards.
