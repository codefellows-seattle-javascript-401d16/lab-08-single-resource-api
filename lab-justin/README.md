#How are you feeling?

In this project I created a RESTful API that allows you to create, read, update, and destroy data. That date being a name, an age, and a feeling of the day. A post, get, put, and delete route constructors are created/managed in router.js. Those routes allow us to apply CRUD operations to our simple resource object that has name, age, and feeling as properties. All tests past for this project.

This was a fun project that lets me get familiar with some of the inner workings of express.
